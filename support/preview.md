If you're working on a web application and want a way to preview your application, just visit the following URL in your browser:

https://__[box-name]__.action.io:__[port]__

Alternatively, if you are using the action WebIDE, you can just click the "Preview" tab and select the port where you are running your web server.

* In the list of your boxes, choose the box where you're running a web server
* Click the "Preview" Menu
* Select the relevant port where you're running a server

And voila!  Hello world!
