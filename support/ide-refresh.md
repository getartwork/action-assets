*Help! My file browser is not loading the directory tree in my project!*

When you launch the Web IDE, if you cannot find any of the folders in your project in the file browser, simply refresh your browser. 

If you still cannot see any of the files in your file browser, try refreshing the page one more time.  

If it's *still* not working, send us an email at [help@action.io]("mailto:help@action.io?subject=file%20browser")
