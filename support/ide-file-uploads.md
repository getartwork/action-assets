Uploading files to Action.IO is quick and easy. There's no need to FTP or SCP files to your development box (although you can, if you want to).

In the file browser, right-click the destination directory where you'd like to upload the image and click "Upload files to [your folder name]".

A file upload modal will appear, where you can drag & drop multiple files or browse for files manually. You can upload a bunch of files at once, so feel free to add up to 5 files at a time.

Once you've dropped the files you want to upload, click the "Upload" button at the bottom right-hand side of the modal.

You'll see the status of each file uploaded via the progress bar to the right of the filename.

<div class="alert alert-notice">
  We support .png, .jpeg, .gif, and .pdf file uploads
</div>

After each file is uploaded successfully, the modal will disapear and you'll be back in the Action.IO IDE. The file browser should refresh automatically and you should see your uploaded files in the correct directory.

If you don't see the files you've uploaded, you can right click and select "Refresh" to refresh the contents of a folder, or click the refresh icon at the top of the file browser to refresh the entire tree.

That's it!  Of course, if you're having any trouble, you can always [get in touch with a human](mailto: support@action.io?subject=File%20Uploads).
